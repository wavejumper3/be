		<h1>How to take attendance quickly</h1>
		<p>So, my professor asked the class - <br><i>"What do you think is the best way to take attendance?"</i><br>I gave a solution I was fairly proud of, but it didn't get used.<br>My professor does web development, so, guess what?</p>
		<h3>I'm gonna make this page an awesome explanation of my proposed solution!</h3>
		<p>Ok, so, it relies on a fair few assumptions.<br>One, it assumes that the majority of people in class will be present.<br>Two, it assumes that mouse clicks and name-calling both take constant time.<br>There's actually two algorithms I'll explain, as well as the one he used.<br>I'll explain his first.</p>
		<h3>This guy's algorithm!!!</h3>
		<p>So, he took the naiive approach:</p>
		<h6>Starting condition: all students are marked as "not marked", set index to first student.</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>Call out that student's name.</li>
			<li>If they respond, mark them present (one mouse click)</li>
			<li>If they do NOT respond after <i>X</i> calls, mark absent (two mouse clicks)</li>
			<li>Move, repeat the above.</li>
			<li>Once done, click "submit"</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now, this does make decent time in the majority of cases, and is O(n). More exactly, its O(2n + 2<i>X</i>[num absent]).</p>
		<p>However, <b>this can be improved!</b><br>Here's...</p>
		<h3>My originally proposed algorithm!!!</h3>
		<p>I noted that the software allows you to mark everyone as present, and that most people <i>are</i> present.</p>
		<h6>Starting condition: all students are marked as "present" (one click), set index to first student.</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>Call out that student's name. (one click)</li>
			<li>If they respond, move on.</li>
			<li>If they do NOT respond after <i>X</i> calls, mark absent (one mouse click)</li>
			<li>Move, repeat the above.</li>
			<li>Once done, click "submit"</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now, this does takes <i>less</i> time in the majority of cases, despite also being O(n). More exactly, though, its O(n + <i>X</i>[num absent] + 1).</p>
		<p><b>2n + 2<i>X</i>[num absent]</b> will usually be larger than <b>n + <i>X</i>[num absent] + 1)</b><br><br>(That's a good thing)</p>
		<br>
		<p>My third algorithm technically adds some optimisation, but requires copying over last class's attendance.<br>Considering most absences are runs, asking "was anyone not here last class?" to correct last week's absences is faster.<br>This is because verifying an absence takes much longer than someone who is there.</p>
