		<h1>Hello, prospective employers!</h1>
			<p>This is a website I created as an about me page.<br>You're on the part that explains that I am able to work, and why you would want to hire me.</p>
			<p>The entire website can be considered an extended cover letter, if you so choose. I made it completely from scratch.</p>
			<p>You'll note this makes no mention of my real name: that's just because its an open website, open to the public.</p>
			<p>I'm very careful with how I handle all things. That includes my work.</p>
			<p>You should check out my <a href="https://github.com/wavejumper3">Github</a> to get a very general sense of what I have done.</p>
			<!-- You can also check out the source code of this page, which contains a wonderful SHA1 hash: -->
			<!-- fcfbf7c7dd89264001cc9d89df0c4435e1b43d67 -->
			<!-- If you want to verify this website was created by me, the person applying, ask me what this is a hash for! It's a first/last name -->
			<p>I have mostly worked with Python, Javascript, Java, and Rust. I have used linux every day for a long time, and I run an ubuntu home server.<br><b>I look forward to working with you!</b></p>
