    <p>I only play the coolest games: <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/">Games that require a high IQ</a>.</p>

    <p>Really though, I play <strong>SSBU</strong> and main <em>Mr. Game and Watch</em>, proving I have no friends.<br>One only mains G&W if they don't want to play the game, and everyone is annoyed by that.</p>

    <p>Here he is:</p>
    <img src="/GAME WATCH.gif">
    <p>I plan on adding a rant later about the Game and Watch lore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I also play other games:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minecraft Java (wavejumpr3)</li>
      <li>Splatoon 3</li>
      <li>A collection of Wii games I didn't get to as a kid</li>
    </ul>

I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.']);
